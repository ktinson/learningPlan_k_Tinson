#With your coach and manager, select the languages, frameworks/libraries, databases, and/or cloud/deployment/tooling learning plans that you plan to complete before starting your job.


--Locate the learning plan that corresponds to your selection.


--Develop a plan for how you will complete all of the required components by the end of week 10.

--Create a repository that will have all of the code you create as you complete the learning plan.

--Explore courses and documentation to learn the skills that are outlined in the learning plain.

--Rebuild Bootcamp projects using the new skills you have learned! For example:
    --If you you learning an object oriented language like Java or C#, then try rebuilding the Scooter project but in the language you are learning.
    --If you are learning about an ORM, try rebuilding the Card Game Project with this ORM.
